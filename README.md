# Overview

The UVE-38K is a large real-world underwater video enhancement dataset with inter-frame consistent refference. The raw underwater videos are collected from the Dive+ community and the underwater object detection dataset of Underwater Robot Picking Contest (URPC). We adopt the following 12 enhancement methods to generate the enhancement candidate pool for each frame i.i., i.e., CLAHE [1], DCP [2], Fusion-based method [3], GBdehaze [4], GC, ICM [5], MIP [6], RGHS [7], ROWS [8], UCM [9] and WaterNet [10], Dive+ [11], and invited volunteers to pick out the best enhancement approach for each video according to their overall performance on the whole video. The videos whose intermediate references include obvious style difference will be applied for further post-refinement to get more consistent and better reference.
It includes:

- 50 video sequences with more than 38,000 frames
- A variety of different resolution sizes, over half videos have larger resolution than 720P
- 7 main scenes and objects and others
